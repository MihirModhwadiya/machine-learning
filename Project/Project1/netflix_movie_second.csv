Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a ""Qadiani""-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community.

English actor and comedian Stephen Fry narrates the English-language version and José María del Río narrates the Castilian Spanish version.

Set in a 3D space, with a plain white background and usually no backdrops, it is about Pocoyo, a 3-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato, Elly and Loula. Viewers are encouraged to recognise situations that Pocoyo is in, and things that are going on with or around him. The narrator usually speaks explicitly to the viewers and to the characters as well. Each character has its own distinctive dance and also a specific sound, and most episodes end with the characters dancing. Many episodes also involve parties.

It was a TTV and Sanlih E-Television co-presentation, and was directed by Xu Fu Jun. The filming started in October 2010, and was first broadcast on 5 November 2010. It’s been on the air ever since.

Before The Fierce Wife was produced, both Sonia Sui and Wen Sheng Hao had acted in two TTV productions, The Year of Happiness and Love and PS Man. The Fierce Wife, The Year of Happiness and Love, and PS Man all feature youth idol.

On 9 June 2011, The Fierce Wife, described as “the most talked about TV show in Taiwan,” entered the Japanese market, renamed Does Marriage Guarantee Happiness. It was broadcast on BS Nittele in Chinese with Japanese subtitles, every Thursday at 2300 in high definition, six times as high as in Taiwan. The whole TV series was divided into 34 episodes in Japan, and the DVDs in both Chinese and Japanese went on sale on 20 June 2012.

The TV series was a big hit in 2011. “Xiaosan” or “Little Third”, “the other woman” in the story, has become a popular euphemism thanks to the show. Also, merchandise has sold well in Taiwan and abroad. The popular drama was nominated for a number of Golden Bell Awards. Some controversial parts of the story received heated discussion, and the producer Wang Pei Hua decided to make it into a feature movie set four years after the main female character Xie An Zhen get divorced. A press conference to announce the film adaptation The Fierce Wife: The Final Episode, was held on 20 January 2012.
